Git Server Plugin
=================

This plugin wraps the server-side functionality of JGit so that other plugins can easily expose
Git repositories from Jenkins via its SSH transport and HTTP in a collaborative fashion.
This plugin is a library plugin, in the sense that it doesn't have any user visible feature on its own.
